 Step-by-Step Workflow Example: Pay As You Go Shop Setup

  1. Feature Planning âœ… COMPLETED

  # Step 1a: Create feature specification
  /specify "pay as you go shop setup"
  # â†’ Created branch: 001-pay-as-you
  # â†’ Generated spec: specs/001-pay-as-you/spec.md

  # Step 1b: Review and clarify requirements
  # Current spec has [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers for:
  # - Payment methods (credit card, ACH, digital wallets?)
  # - Billing cycle (daily, weekly, monthly?)
  # - Currency support (single or multiple?)
  # - Usage limits (required or optional?)

  2. Development Process

  # Step 2a: Set up task tracking
  # Use TodoWrite to plan implementation tasks

  # Step 2b: Break down into development tasks
  TodoWrite:
  - [ ] Create shop configuration UI
  - [ ] Implement usage tracking system
  - [ ] Build pricing tier management
  - [ ] Add customer dashboard
  - [ ] Integrate payment processing
  - [ ] Create billing statement generation

  # Step 2c: Implement each task with commits
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add shop configuration form for pay-as-you-go setup

  # Step 2d: Continue with each feature
  # Mark TodoWrite items as completed after each implementation

  3. Quality Assurance

  # Step 3a: Run tests
  npm test
  # or
  yarn test

  # Step 3b: Check code quality
  npm run lint
  npm run typecheck

  # Step 3c: Fix any issues found
  # Update TodoWrite if new tasks emerge from testing

  # Step 3d: Manual testing
  # Test shop setup flow end-to-end
  # Verify usage tracking works
  # Check billing calculation accuracy

  4. Deployment

  # Step 4a: Create pull request
  gh pr create --title "Add pay-as-you-go shop setup" --body "
